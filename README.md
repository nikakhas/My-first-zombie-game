# Mini-Zombie-Attack
My first game on C++ using SFML.
Please, make sure that you have installed SFML SDK and changed the SFML folder's path in project's properties to yours.
Here is a documentation that can help you to install SFML SDK:
https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-vc.php

Use ARROWS to move, SPACE to jump, K to attack.
A cheat: click Z to kill all enemies at once.
